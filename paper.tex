      In the United States, a \textit{congressional district} is a contiguous geographical region containing approximately 700,000 people. In an action called \textit{redistricting}, state legislature redraws these boundaries following each nationwide census.

    is the action of partitioning a geographical region into smaller subregions The problem of districting maintains a steadfast presence within We utilized public, official data of the demographics of voters in the states of California and Texas as our dataset from the recent years. Then, code in C++ was written to perform our Markov Chain where we apply the probability of each demographic group into a matrix. Our results were compared to current district maps to identify the geographical differences of the districts.

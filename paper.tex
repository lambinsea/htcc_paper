    Our study analyzed current district maps through our mathematical model. We utilized public, official data of the demographics of voters in the states of California and Texas as our dataset from the recent years. Then, code in C++ was written to perform our Markov Chain where we apply the probability of each demographic group into a matrix. Our results were compared to current district maps to identify the geographical differences of the districts.
